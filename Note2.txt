If delete leave grade -> status "Deleted"
because leave grade history needs its name
Employees leave grade -> unassigned?? or cannot delete?
Refresh leave every year
Effective until date time

Status for leave entitlement
change when changing leave grade ->
leave type is not included in the leave entitlement of the leave grade
change back if assign to another leave grade with the leave type

Leave entitlement
update when changing leave grade

When is the leave considered taken?
When the leave is approved?
Then if the leave is cancelled/rejected,
check if it is approved before, then deduct if it is approved.

Edit leave entitlement for individual employee
after assign
because I think it would be easier, hohoho

     total_days (if different from leave grade, customize?)
     (for each if (leaveEntitlement->leaveType !== numOfDays isCustomize = true)
     leaves_taken
     remaining_days ??
     year
