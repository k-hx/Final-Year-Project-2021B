4. Show employee's leave data in the employee's leave grade page and apply leave page?
5. Approve/Reject leave - checkbox

When apply/approve multiple leave, days may exceed remaining days
Solution 1: when approving, check if exceed
Solution 2: check pending leave application total days for the leave type. â˜…
If exceeds limit when combining with current leave application, cannot.
Solution 3: add to leaves taken when apply, deduct if is rejected

Controller: get leave application of the employee (use Auth::id())
View: add total days of leave applications for the selected leave type
          -> when select leave type for the leave application
          -> when select date

Leave Problem
Did not check holiday, weekend, overlap leave application, etc.
Employee Leave Record is renewed every year, so when applying leave for the next year, it will be included in this year's record
Haven't have update leave application status to "Expired" when date is passed

Finished
2. Employees leave grade -> unassigned?? or cannot delete?
3. Refresh leave every year
4. Effective until date time
5. If delete leave grade -> status "Deleted"
   because leave grade history needs its name
6. delete leave grade id at the route, link, and function for addLeaveEntitlement (better don't)
1. Cannot delete a leave grade when it is assigned to employee
3. Change employee's leave when add/remove/edit number of days for leave entitlement for a leave grade and delete leave entitlement
6. If no remaining days, change to unpaid leave?
update leaves taken when cancel leave
Unpaid leave -> create when creating the table (in the end I use database seeding)

Unpaid Leave
Add columns "paid_num_of_days" "unpaid_num_of_days" at leave application (is not applied now)
Unpaid leave -> create when creating the table (in the end I use database seeding)
Command:
php artisan make:seeder LeaveTypeSeeder
composer dump-autoload
php artisan db:seed

Status for employee's leave record
change when changing leave grade ->
leave type is not included in the leave entitlement of the leave grade
change back if assign to another leave grade with the leave type

Leave entitlement
update when changing leave grade

Update employee's leave
-> when adding leave entitlement for a leave grade
-> when changing leave grade
-> when editing/updating leave entitlement for a leave grade
-> when deleting a leave grade?? Can it be deleted?

Update leaves taken
When is the leave considered taken?
When the leave is approved?
Then if the leave is cancelled/rejected,
check if it is approved before, then deduct if it is approved.
what if the leave application expires?

Update employee's leave grade after deleting a leave grade?
Leave grade cannot be deleted when it is assigned to at least an employee. Case closed.

Do they need a leave table for all employees?
-> employee_leave table
-> created when set leave grade for employee
-> data field:
     employee (employee ID)
     leave_type (leave type ID)
     total_days (if different from leave grade, customize?)
     (for each if (leaveEntitlement->leaveType !== numOfDays isCustomize = true)
     leaves_taken
     remaining_days ??
     year

update when:
add leave entitlements to leave grade
edit leave entitlements of a leave grade
delete leave entitlement of a leave grade


Employee's leave grade history
-> employee (employee ID)
-> leave grade (leave grade ID)
-> effective_from
-> effective_until

Change leave grade
-> display all employees or only the employee?

If change leave grade before year ends
-> remaining_days
     = new total days - (old total days - remaining days)
deduct the leaves taken

2. Employees' leave grade
Set leave grade for employee
Change employee's leave grade

3. Apply leave
paid leave OR unpaid leave
calculate remaining leave
If remaining days < 1 then cannot take the type of leave

Renew leaves every year manually
-> refresh button
-> find employee leave grade
-> create employee_leaves

4. When employee is no longer working for the company, what should the leave grade be? (skipped)

5. What if a leave application expires? (skipped)

Pagination (skipped)
show leave according to month, year

Input select (skipped)
no default like "Select xxxxx"

Edit leave entitlement for individual employee
after assign
because I think it would be easier, hohoho

1. Employees' leave
View own leave grade
use the Auth::id()???? method
